Covid 19 Data Exploration


Skills used: Joins, CTE, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions




-- Data Exploration Queries


-- Query 1: Retrieve all records with non-null continent
SELECT *
FROM `covidportfolioproject-389304.covid_deaths.CovidDeaths`
WHERE continent IS NOT NULL;


-- Query 2: Selected specific columns for initial data exploration
SELECT location, date, total_cases, new_cases, total_deaths, population
FROM `covidportfolioproject-389304.covid_deaths.CovidDeaths`
WHERE continent IS NOT NULL;


-- Query 3: Calculate death percentage by country
SELECT location, date, total_cases, total_deaths, (total_deaths/total_cases)*100 AS death_percentage
FROM `covidportfolioproject-389304.covid_deaths.CovidDeaths`
WHERE location like '%United States%'AND continent IS NOT NULL;


-- Query 4: Total Cases vs Population
—-Shows what percentage of the population got Covid
SELECT location, date, population, total_cases, (total_cases/population)*100 AS population_infected_percentage
FROM `covidportfolioproject-389304.covid_deaths.CovidDeaths`;


– Query 5: Countries with highest infection rate compared to population
SELECT location, population, MAX(total_cases) AS highest_infected_count, MAX((total_cases/population))*100 AS population_infected_percentage
FROM `covidportfolioproject-389304.covid_deaths.CovidDeaths`
GROUP BY location, population
ORDER BY population_infected_percentage DESC;




-- Data Visualization Queries


--Query 6: Countries with highest death count per population
SELECT location,MAX(total_deaths) AS total_death_count
FROM `covidportfolioproject-389304.covid_deaths.CovidDeaths`
WHERE continent IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY location

-- Query 7: Continents with the highest death count per population
SELECT continent,MAX(total_deaths) AS total_death_count
FROM `covidportfolioproject-389304.covid_deaths.CovidDeaths`
WHERE continent IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY continent
ORDER BY total_death_count DESC;


-- Query 8: Global Numbers for total cases, total deaths and death percentage
SELECT SUM(new_cases) AS total_cases, SUM(new_deaths) AS total_deaths, SUM(new_deaths)/SUM(new_cases)*100 AS death_percentage
FROM `covidportfolioproject-389304.covid_deaths.CovidDeaths`
